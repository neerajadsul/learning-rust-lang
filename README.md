# Learning Rust Programming Language 
The repository contains code written while learning Rust programming language.
I used Rust's official guides and books:

1. Rust by example to get an idea and stimulate the neurons :) \
    https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/
2. The main reference for comprehensive understanding but time-consuming \
    https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
3. Interactive learning by error fixing exercises \
    https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/
4. For microcontroller programming domain \
    https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/embedded-book/
